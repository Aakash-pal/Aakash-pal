### 🔧 Skills & Technologies

- **Languages & Tools:** SQL (PostgreSQL, T-SQL), Python (Pandas)/(learning), Git, Docker, Batch
- **ETL Pipelines:** SQL-based extraction, regex-powered transformation, conditional repair logic
- **Data Cleaning:** Contextual inference, null handling, regex validation
- **Automation:** Dockerized pipelines, Task Scheduler, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- **Cloud Tools:** Apache Airflow with Docker orchestration
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MSSQL, DBeaver

### 📂 Featured Projects

#### 🧼 ETL Café Sales Pipeline — *From Raw to Reliable*
> A complete data engineering project simulating real-world ETL operations. It includes raw ingestion, complex SQL logic repair using CTEs, Dockerized orchestration, and scheduled automation.

**Key highlights:**
- Built a multi-step **SQL pipeline** for cleaning `item`, `payment_method`, and `location` using **regex-safe contextual logic**
- Used **CTEs** and layered subqueries to preserve clean values while repairing invalid entries
- Implemented **Docker-based containerization** and automated with **Windows Task Scheduler**
- Structured and documented for professional GitHub presentation
